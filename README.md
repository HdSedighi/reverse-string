# Intuition
<!-- Describe your first thoughts on how to solve this problem. -->
To reverse a string in place, we can use a two-pointer approach. By initializing one pointer at the beginning of the array and the other at the end, we can swap the characters at these positions and then move the pointers towards each other. This process continues until the pointers meet in the middle. This approach ensures that we only need to traverse the array once, making it efficient.

# Approach
<!-- Describe your approach to solving the problem. -->
1. Initialize two pointers: left at the beginning (index 0) and right at the end (index s.Length - 1) of the character array.
2. Use a while loop to continue swapping characters at these positions until the left pointer is no longer less than the right pointer.
3. Inside the loop:
- Swap the characters at left and right indices.
- Increment the left pointer by 1.
- Decrement the right pointer by 1.
4. The loop terminates when the pointers meet in the middle, indicating that the entire array has been reversed in place.
# Complexity
- Time complexity:
<!-- Add your time complexity here, e.g. $$O(n)$$ -->
The time complexity is O(n), where n is the length of the array. This is because we traverse half of the array and perform a constant-time swap operation for each character.

- Space complexity:
<!-- Add your space complexity here, e.g. $$O(n)$$ -->
The space complexity is O(1). We are using a constant amount of extra space (for the pointers and a temporary variable for swapping) regardless of the input size. This satisfies the in-place modification requirement.

# Code
```
using System.Threading.Tasks;
public class Solution {
    public void ReverseString(char[] s) {
     int left = 0;
        int right = s.Length - 1;

        while (left < right)
        {
            // Swap the characters at left and right indices
            char temp = s[left];
            s[left] = s[right];
            s[right] = temp;

            // Move the pointers towards the center
            left++;
            right--;
        }
        
    }
}
```
